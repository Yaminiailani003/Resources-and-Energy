# Resources-and-Energy
## Executive summary
This document describes the Australian Resources & Energy Products. Through this document, I want to know about the followings:-
- The relation between price, production and exploration expenditure of gold .
- How the coals are produced in Australia and which coal are exported the most.
- What is role of petroleum production on Australia and which of the petroleum products is produced the most
- The share of different export destination and share of different iron ore products in total exports of iron ore in Australia.
- The exploration expenditure of total resources and energy.
- To compare the different business sector’s income index and share of different sectors of  Australia’s business income.

To know all this I have picked up the data from the link given below:-
__WWW.INDUSTRY.GOV.AU/REQ__

__Conclusion/Insights of the project__
__Gold:-__ Australia is the world’s no. 1 producer of gold, approximate 187,200 tones of gold mined since the beginning of civilization. The US federal reserves holds 6,700 tones of gold. Gold makes up per billion of the Earth’s outer layer. The gold price did not fluctuate so much from 1990 to 2007 but it went up completely. When the exploration expenditure of gold is high in a particular year & after some years gold production becomes high and as soon as the production of gold becomes high, the price of gold starts coming down.

__Coal:-__ There are two types of coal metallurgical and thermal coal. Australia is world’s no. 1 metallurgical coal exporter , almost all of metallurgical coal is exported. When we produce raw coal, we get only 70-85% of saleable coal. From the last 20 years, metallurgical coal export has always been more than thermal coal.
Petroleum:- Australia petroleum exports do not have major role in global prices but crude oil & refinery production is highest in Australia’s petroleum production.

__Iron Ore:-__ Australia’s half of the earnings comes from iron ore alone and China is the most favorable destination of Australian iron ore export. The fine product has been highest in iron ore export and It has been growing steadily for the last few years and the share of lump & run product in iron ore export has been decreasing continuously for last few years and the share of pallets, slinters and briquettes in iron ore export has been very less. 

__Total Resources & Energy:-__ The exploration expenditure of resources and energy has remained almost same from march 1990 to may 2005 after that the exploration expenditure of energy starts getting high which means Australia starts spending more money to find energy mines. 

__Australia’s Business Income:-__ After 2004, income from mining and EGW increased significantly. Currently these two sectors drive most of the income.  Australia's business income is very dependent on mining sector. In 1990, the share of both mining and manufacturing in Australia business income was almost equal, but in 1998 the share of mining had gone down & the share of manufacturing had gone up significantly. After 2004, the share of mining continued to increase significantly in total business of Australia and share of manufacturing decreased day by day
